# Insecure Shell

Tired of using the **bloated** and overly **complex monstrosity** that is **SSH**? 

Insecure Shell follows a more carefree approach. Forget about encryption, authentication, and all those other **buzzwords**. Just let your data roam free across the internet! Who needs 'permissions' when you can run everything as root? Say goodbye to all the 'fancy' features you find in SSH. Insecure Shell offers you a **pure**, unadulterated, and **unapologetically simple** experience.

## Usage
Run `ish.sh`.
